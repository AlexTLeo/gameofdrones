-- Project description --
Drone0, made by group FeMi (Michele Pestarino S4672032, Federico Sacco S4672010).
The goal of our drone is to move randomly in the map without knowing anything about it, accordingly to the responses given by the master process.

-- Driving Idea --
Our drone after having established a socket connection with the master, will move for a certain number of STEPS, by choosing a new direction that minimize the distance with respect to the defined goal (found randomly).
If the drone gets 3 "detected collisions" in a row from the master, then it will choose another goal.
When the drone runs out of fuel, it will signal to the master that it is refuelling by sending to the main process its current position.
Every step is done at a rate of 5 steps/second, every refuelling lasts 3 seconds.
This is done, possibly, forever.
In order to compile the code run 'gcc drone0.c .o drone0 -lm'
