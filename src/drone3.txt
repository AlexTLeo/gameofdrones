#############################drone3##############################
The code and the executables contained in these folders make up
our supergroup project aimed at creating a system of autonomous
drones moving in the same map while avoiding collisions thanks
to the supervision of a singular central master. Our task was to
create the third drone of the system, contained in drone3.c.

Specifics: Our drone starts from an initial position included
in the values.h file shared between all members of the supergroup
and moves in a randomly choosen direction 3 times before changing
its orientation. Each movement is notified to the master through 
sockets, that must be in agreement with it for it to take place
(otherwise the drone will be forced to change direction). Our
drone also simulates expending fuel each time it takes action, 
and handles refueling after landing according to our assignment
specifications. Other than refueling after landing, we also 
implemented 3 different additional features:
- visualization of the already explored area (the drone will
  print the whole last followed path each time it lands)
- coverage algorithm (keeps into account the percentage of the
  map covered by the drone during its motion by comparing each
  new position with the coverage matrix)
- vertical motion (3D movement done with the addition of
  the z axis but not set to work in the current state due to the
  fact that we would need all drones and master to be able to
  handle 3D motion for the whole system to work -> we left it
  commented)

Instructions: to use our program, you must run all processes 
developed by the supergroup concurrently. Since we only have the
executables of the processes of the other groups, this can only
be done by:
