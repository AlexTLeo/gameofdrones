[drone1.c]

This process handles the movement of a drone on axes x and y.
The drone retrieves its initial coordinates, computes new ones over a random direction and sends them to the master.

It then moves if the master authorizes it. 

If the drone does not have fuel anymore it waits 20 steps before refueling and sending new coordinates again.
